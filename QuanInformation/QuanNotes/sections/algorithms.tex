Let $f: \{0,1\} \rightarrow \{0,1\}$ be a boolean function with one-bit input. We would like to ascertain if $f$ is either constant (both inputs have the same value) or balanced (inputs have different values). Through the classical perspective, one would have to query the function twice to determine the state of $f$ as constant or balanced. However, we can leverage quantum mechanics so that $f$ will only have to the queried once.

We will
